Javascript:
    1->getElementbyID("Id");
    2->createElement("h1");
    3->innerText("providin inner text");
    4->appendChild():Child should be node 
ReactDom & React:
    React.createElement(type,props,value)
    React->just for javascript
    ReactDom->To manipulate DOM we need reactDom
        ReactDom,render(1,2) need 2 things  
            1->new element
            2->target element
    props : properties
            1->Movement of data from one functional component to 
                another function component can be easily done by props.
        

JSX:
    HTML inside javascript
    JSX is advance feature of javascript
    babel:
        we can use html elements inside javascript
        it is used to convert html elements provided in script to React elements
    functional Components:
        funnction Hello(){return()}
        ()=>{} //Arrow frunction
        let Hello = function(){return()}


Virtual DOM:
    It will create by react
    whenever changes in react it actually happens in virtual-dom . 
    if virtual-dom not same as Real-dom    
        then the changes made to the Real-DOM in one GO
    Updating Virtual-DOM is super fast . So,this is the reson react uses virtual-DOM.

while using arrow function no need to bind
But while defining normal function we have to bid that function.


componentDidMount():
    Called immediately after a component is mounted. 
    Setting state here will trigger re-rendering

componentWillUnmount():
    Called immediately before a component is destroyed.
    Perform any necessary cleanup in this method,
    such as cancelled network requests,
    or cleaning up any DOM elements created in componentDidMount
componentDidupdate():
    Called immediately after updating occurs. 
    Not called for the initial render.
    The snapshot is only present if getSnapshotBeforeUpdate is present 
    and returns non-null.

useEffect(() => {
    effect                 //componentDidMount
    return () => {
        cleanup           //componentWillUnmount
    }
}, [])                   []=> if there is an empty array it will work as componentDidMount otherwise component will get updated



Example:
    //Component did mount only
    useEffect(()=>{
        console.log("App Mounted");
    },[])


    //componentWillUnmount
    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("Image Mount");
        const interval = setInterval(()=>{
            console.log("Hello")
        },1000)
     return()=>{
        console.log("image unmount");
        clearInterval(interval);
     }
         
    }, [])



    //componentDidupdate
    useEffect(()=>{
        ----
        ----
    },[value])

//iterator
images.map((image)=>{
    return(
        ----
    );
})
[...images] spread operator

this is for class based Components
